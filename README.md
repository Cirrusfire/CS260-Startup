# Personal Trip Planner
### Elevator Pitch
Always wanted to plan a trip, but the upfront effort to actually plan the whole thing is too much? The Personal Trip Planner is here to change that! The Personal Trip Planner, or PTP, will give you popular locations from your destination along with an average rating from those who've visited those location on their own trips. From these popular locations, you can give them a 'desire to visit' rating and store them in your itinerary page. Once you've finished picking your favorites, you can specify what days you want to visit them and the PTP will put them onto a calendar for you and you're done! Instead of hunting for every location you want to go on your trip, they came to you in one easy place and you're ready to pack your bags and book a plane ticket!
